# Some Project Ideas for Google Charts

1. Make a custom chart
   > - Make a sales report of merchandise sales every month for a popular clothing store

> > You can use a line chart to show sales numbers of various clothing items

> > You can make a pie chart showing percentage of sales for different clothing items annually

> - Make a weather forecast for a city over the next week

> > Use a bar chart to show different weather attributes for each day of the week.

> > Use a line chart to show relationships between humidity, temperature and precipitation.

> - Make a chart demonstrating social media usage.

> > Make a pie chart showing percentage of minutes spent on each social media platform in a day.

> > Make a line chart showing how your social media usage has changed by average daily hours since you were a young child to now and predict future usage.

2. Edit your custom chart
   > > Use the google chart options to modify the look and design of your chart. Make the bars, lines or pie slickes a different color scheme. Modify the width of your bars are text size of your titles.

> > Share out the options that you were able to modify.

3. Build and host your own data API using GitHub pages OR find an API online and access their data to build a custom chart.
